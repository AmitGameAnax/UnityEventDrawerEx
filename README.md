## Description


#### What is runtime call?

*Button.onClick* and *Toggle.OnChangeValue* etc. are known as **UnityEvent**.  
UnityEvent has two types of callbacks:

* Persistent call
    * You can add callbacks from the inspector.
    * You can add callbacks from a script using *UnityEventTools.AddPersistentListener*.
    * It is Serialized.
    * It is displayed in the inspector.  
    ![persistent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12690315/40887795-f5eb7ac4-6788-11e8-9e73-6831e3eab08f.png)
* **Runtime call**
    * You can add a callback from a script using *UnityEvent.AddListener*.
    * It is not serialized.
    * It is not displayed in the inspector.  
    ![runtime](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12690315/40887784-c8c2027a-6788-11e8-83f7-07e38e187cba.png)

#### Display your runtime call

This plugin extends *UnityEventDrawer* to display runtime calls in inspector.  
If runtime call is an instance method, its target is also displayed.  
This plugin supports all events that inherit `UnityEvent<T0> - UnityEvent<T0, T1, T2, T3>` as well as *UnityEvent*.  
Also, when the Persistent call is empty, *UnityEvent* is displayed compactly in inspector.  

```cs
public class TestBehavior : MonoBehaviour
{
	[System.Serializable] public class TransformUnityEvent : UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent<Transform>{};

	[SerializeField] TransformUnityEvent onYourCustomEvent = new TransformUnityEvent();
	
	void OnEnable()
	{
		onYourCustomEvent.AddListener(TestTransform);
	}
	
	void TestTransform(Transform t)
	{
		Debug.Log("TestTransform has called : " + t);
	}
}
```
